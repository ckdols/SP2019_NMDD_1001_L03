**Due Next Class:**
Continue working with P5.js.  Create 2 P5.js 'sketches'.  First, make a static pattern using for loops to create repetition and sequence.  For your second sketch, make a dynamic pattern using for loops to create repetition.  Dynamic can mean interactive and uses mouse functions built into the p5 library.  You can also rely on time and have a sketch slowly evolve or animate over a set duration.
