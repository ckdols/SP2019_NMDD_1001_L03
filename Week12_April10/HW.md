Think about your finals projects this weekend.  These will be due May 1st!  The whole thing just snuck up on us!!! 

**Using P5.js, what would you like to make?** 

I am going to be fairly open about what you do for this.  Consider making a interactive narrative, a game, a cool interactive visual element, an infographic, or something playful and potentially useless.  Think hard about what is possible given the platform and the time till the end of the semester. How can this relate to personal interests.  

Come to next class with ideas, inspiration, and a working first draft in P5 of what you would like to tackle for your final.

Literally no wrong answers to this project and where it can go.
