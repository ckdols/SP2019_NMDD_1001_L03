**_Assignment 1:_** Post a URL link of your CopePen project to your blog.

In [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/), make 3 Unique HTML/CSS layouts of your choice.  Start with hand drawn sketches and try to replicate your layouts using HTML and CSS styling.  Post your URL links (x3) as well as images (x3) of your sketches.  Make clear to me which drawings match which urls.

Your codePen should have:

* Proper file to file links in your index.html
* Use of both Classes and IDs
* Organization and proper syntax for both HTML and CSS files.
* Incorperate fun styles, fonts, colors, and images into your layouts.  Filler text is ok.
