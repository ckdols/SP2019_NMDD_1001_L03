**_Assignment 1:_** Please post image to your blog.

Make a photo collage poster of something which inspires you.  You can draw inspiration from your favorite book, poem, movie, TV show, story, event, person, celebrity, icon, place, destination etc.  These photo collages, should be primarily constructed from found and personal photos.  You can also use patterns, textures, and other drawings to create supplementary content. 

The point of the assignment is to exercise the use of the Principles of Design and practice using Photoshop and Illustrator workflow.  Pay close attention to your use of Color, Space, Balance, Repetition, Rhythm, Movement, Contrast, and Scale.  Also be critical of your use of Typography, Alignment, Proximity, Hierarchy, and Consistency.

**_Assignment 2:_** Post a URL link to your project on your blog.

Make a basic HTML information page for your photo collage poster.  As I demonstrated in class, use _CodePen.io_ to write and host your HTML project.  Link the image url from your blog to the page and add a title with a written description about the content and intention behind your design.  

* What was your source of inspiration?
* Why did you chose this composition?
* Where did you get your content?
* What design principles did you use effectively and why?
