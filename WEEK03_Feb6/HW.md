**_Assignment 1:_** Post a URL link of your CopePen project to your blog.**

Make a basic HTML information page for your photocollage poster, and style it in CSS with fonts and colors.  As I demonstrated in class, use _CodePen.io_ to write and host your HTML/CSS project.  Add images of your photocollage process and your final product.  Create a short narrative for the project and give the a written description of what you were thinking in the work, what it represents, and issues that you had in making it, etc.

Your codePen should have:

* A HTML Head (with relevant style links....ie.. google font links)
* A HTML Body using appropriate Headings, Paragraph, Divs, Image Links, etc.
* CSS font styles
* CSS colors
