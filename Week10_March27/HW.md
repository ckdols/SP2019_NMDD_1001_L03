Great job on you Midterms!  From here on out we will be playing with [P5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/), a fantastic tool for learning the basics of funtional programming and object oriented programming.  This will also work as an intro to more abstract new media design including interaction design, experience design, data art, physical computing etc.

Please use the [p5.js webeditor](https://editor.p5js.org/) as your text editor platform.  It will be very similar to CodePen.

Also, explore the [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) for ready to use functions.

**Due Next Class:**
Create 2 P5.js 'sketches'.  The first sketch should be a static composition using color functions and primitive shapes. The second sketch should be a type of drawing tool using mouse functions and/or changing variables.
