_Midterm will be due March 17th by 12:00 am Eastern time._


Chose an artist, designer, collective, musician, band, athlete, theorist, scientist etc who inspires you or your work.

**Make a website for this person.**  Treat them like a client.  Think about the content that would be necessary for their website.  If they have a website already, I encourage you to look at their site and model you project from what exists.  Alternatively, you can also chose to make a personal web portfolio if you have a personal practice and visual documentation of your work.

Schedule:

**March 6th:**

* 3 precedent websites which will inform your design process.  (add links to blog)

* 1 developed wireframe made in Illustrator which shows a concrete design plan.  Fonts, spacing (margin/padding), blocks, images, alignment, positioning etc...  should be indicated in an annotation color of your choice. (post high quality jpegs to blog)

* 1 HTML/CSS Style Guide with fonts, colors, and sizing specified as a base template for all other HTML pages. (post CodePen url link to your blog)

* Begin the “skeleton” for your final project in HTML/CSS.  Come to class prepared to work on troubleshoot any issues

Note: the precedent websites should be similar in content and design to what you would like to achieve in your final project.  What makes them work? What doesn’t work? Pick and choose the attributes that work for your site and work them into your project.

**Week of March 13th:**

Have a working site with all your content, images, and links in place.  Your project should also have a working CSS style sheet for all HTML pages.  Ideally, you should have 95% of the project done.  You may have issues will linking pages or special styling issues.  I will host extended office hours that week to get everyones' sites up to speed.

**Final Submissions should include the following:**

* 3 Precendent Websites
* 1 Wireframe
* 1 Style Guide
* Complete HTML/CSS project with working links and content complete.
